Some playing with OpenCV
My Idea was to make an app which recognizes celebrities and make money, but google just released an app which does just that (http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/27/4153396/googles-knowledge-graph-expands-into-movies-on-android-tablets-thanks)
So I am dropping this project and putting it in the pool in the hope the code, which is in early development stages and is highly experimental and very messy might one day be usedful to anyone
